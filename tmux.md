# Terminal Multiplexers

Wikipedia:

>A terminal multiplexer is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the Unix shell that started the program.

# GNU Screen

Has anyone used `screen`?

---

# GNU Screen

- Released in 1987
- Hard to configure
- Still missing basic features like vertical splits

# tmux

From [http://tmux.sourceforge.net/](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/):
>tmux is intended to be a modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen. Major features include:

>A powerful, consistent, well-documented and easily scriptable command interface.
A window may be split horizontally and vertically into panes.
Panes can be freely moved and resized, or arranged into preset layouts.
Support for UTF-8 and 256-colour terminals.
Copy and paste with multiple buffers.
Interactive menus to select windows, sessions or clients.
Change the current window by searching for text in the target.
Terminal locking, manually or after a timeout.
A clean, easily extended, BSD-licensed codebase, under active development.

# Configuration

Unlike `screen`, `tmux` has nice defaults.

Some recommended tweaks to add to your `~/.tmux.conf`:
    
    # Use 1 as the first index
    set -g base-index 1
	
    # Replace C-b as the default, use what screen does
	set-option -g prefix C-a
    
    # Just click it
	set-option -g mouse-select-pane on
    set-option -g mouse-select-window on
    set-option -g mouse-resize-pane on

---

# Configuration
    
    # Scroll your way into copy mode (scrollback buffer)
    # and select text for copying with the mouse
    setw -g mode-mouse on
	
    # Remove delay between prefix and command
    set -s escape-time 0
	
    # command sequence for nested tmux sessions
    bind-key a send-prefix
	
    # Fix wacky colors
    set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
    
    # Use intuitive bindings for splitting panes
    bind | split-window -h
    bind - split-window -v

# Appendix

iTerm2 - Copy and paste doesn't work correctly. Hold Option when selecting text.
