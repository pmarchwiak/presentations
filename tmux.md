# Terminal Multiplexers

Wikipedia:

>A terminal multiplexer is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the Unix shell that started the program.

# tmux!

- Started in 2007
- 

---

# Installation

On Mac use [`homebrew`](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

    marchwiakmd$ brew install tmux

---

# Configuration

Unlike `screen`, `tmux` has nice defaults.

Some recommended tweaks to add to your `~/.tmux.conf`:
    
    # Use 1 as the first index
    set -g base-index 1                                                                                                                            
    
    # Replace C-b as the default, use what screen does                                                                                                                                                                              
    set-option -g prefix C-a

    set-option -g mouse-select-pane on                                                                                                                                     
    set-option -g mouse-select-window on
